                <h1>Air Jordan I <br>SHADOW</h1>
                <p>Red and royal blue have always been primary colors for Jordan Brand. But even back in Year One, when the signature line was still gaining altitude, the Air Jordan I dabbled in grey. The color would come off the bench again and again in the ensuing years, delivering some of the most coveted releases in sneaker history. Now the shoe that introduced the shade returns, sporting a high top, full-grain leather and the same shadowy color combo first seen in 1985.</p>
